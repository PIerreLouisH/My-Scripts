# Script Collection

This repository is a collection of various scripts I've created for different purposes. The scripts are organized into three main directories:

1. [FFMPEG](FFMPEG/)
2. [Reivax](reivax/)
3. [Divers](Divers/)

## FFMPEG

This directory contains scripts for video processing using FFMPEG. The scripts include:


- [ConvertirEnMP4](FFMPEG/ConvertirEnMP4/conversion.bat): A script to convert AVI files to MP4.
- [FusionnerMesMP4](FFMPEG/FusionnerMesMP4/fusion.bat): A script to merge multiple MP4 files into one.

## Reivax

The [Reivax](reivax/) directory contains scripts for a Discord bot. The bot is designed for role-playing games and allows users to create and manage their character sheets directly within Discord.
It will automaticallty fill and generate the PDF file with the data sent by the user.

## Divers

The [Divers](Divers/) directory contains various other scripts.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
